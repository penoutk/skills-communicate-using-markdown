**What is Markdown?** <ins>***Markdown***</ins> is a simple way to format text that looks great on any device. It doesn’t do anything fancy like change the font size, color, or type — just the essentials, using keyboard symbols you already know. You can format text to add a heading, lists, bold, italics, tables, and many other stylings. You can use Markdown in most places around GitHub:

- Comments on issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Files with the .md or .markdown extension
- Sharing snippets of text in Gists

**What is a header?** A <ins>***header***</ins> is a larger bit of text at the beginning of a section. There are six sizes.

## Example

> ```
> # Heading 1
> ## Heading 2
> ##### Heading 4
> ```

Images are almost identical to links, but an image starts with an exclamation point `!`. Include descriptive text in the square brackets `![alt-text](image.png)`. This alternate (alt) text is displayed when the image can't be shown, or for the visually impaired. It's also shown at times when your image doesn't display, such as when there's a poor connection. Additionally this text is read aloud for people using screen readers.
