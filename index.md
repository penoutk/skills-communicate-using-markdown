# Communicate using Markdown

**What is Markdown?** <ins>***Markdown***</ins> is a simple way to format text that looks great on any device. It doesn’t do anything fancy like change the font size, color, or type — just the essentials, using keyboard symbols you already know. You can format text to add a heading, lists, bold, italics, tables, and many other stylings. You can use Markdown in most places around GitHub:

- Comments on issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Files with the .md or .markdown extension
- Sharing snippets of text in Gists

**What is a header?** A <ins>***header***</ins> is a larger bit of text at the beginning of a section. There are six sizes.

## Example

> ```
> # Heading 1
> ## Heading 2
> ##### Heading 4
> ```
